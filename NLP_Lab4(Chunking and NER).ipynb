By the time the course came to an end, he had proved his mettle. \n",

He has been highly active in the technical scene of our college too with him organizing many events.\n",

Despite X not being from a computer science background, his project did not languish. He went above and beyond to make a professional database design, which included an ‘Auto-Increment’ feature using a PL/SQL sequence written by him, bulk insertion into the table and other features.\n",

He designed this tool to make the process of configuring a Logical Data Model easier and much faster. It consisted of a User Interface (UI) that can replicate back-end tasks such as inserting data in a database at the click of a button. His task was cut out for him as the tool was being built for J.P. Morgan Chase as a client and hence there was no room for error. I am proud to say that the tool, which he built over a course of two months, was pushed to production at the end of his internship.\n",
